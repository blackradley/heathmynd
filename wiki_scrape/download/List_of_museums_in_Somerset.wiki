The [[Ceremonial counties of England|English ceremonial county]] of [[Somerset]] contains a wide range of [[museum]]s, defined here as institutions (including [[nonprofit organisation]]s, government entities, and private [[business]]es) that collect and care for objects of cultural, artistic, scientific, or historical interest and make their collections or related exhibits available for public viewing. Non-profit [[Art museum|art galleries]] and university art galleries are also included, but museums that exist only in cyberspace (i.e., [[virtual museum]]s) are not.

Many of the museums are in [[listed building]]s. In the United Kingdom, this signifies a building which has been placed on the Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest. In [[England and Wales]], the authority for listing is granted by the [[Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990]], and is presently administered by [[English Heritage]]. Listed buildings in danger of decay are included on English Heritage's [[Buildings at Risk Register]]. There are three types of listed status: Grade I, for buildings &quot;of exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important&quot;; Grade II*, for &quot;particularly important buildings of more than special interest&quot;; and Grade II, for buildings that are &quot;nationally important and of special interest&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Listed buildings|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/protecting/heritage-protection/what-can-we-protect/listed-buildings/|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the museums have been accredited by the [[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council]], which sets national standards for museums in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accreditation Scheme|url=http://www.mla.gov.uk/what/raising_standards/accreditation|publisher=The [[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council]] (MLA)|accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several are [[art gallery|art galleries]] providing space for the [[art exhibition|exhibition of art]], or are [[Philatelic Museum|philatelic]], [[Regimental museum|regimental]], [[Science museum|science]], [[Aviation museum|aviation]], [[Transport museum|transport]], [[Railway museum|railway]], [[Toy museum|toy]], religious or sports museums, but the majority are [[local museum]]s. There are also several [[historic house museum]]s owned or managed by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] or [[English Heritage]].

The [[Peat Moors Centre]], [[Westhay]], was dedicated to the [[archaeology]], [[history]] and [[geology]] of the [[Somerset Levels]]. It also included reconstructions of some of the archaeological discoveries, including a number of [[Iron Age]] round houses from [[Glastonbury Lake Village]], and the world's oldest engineered highway, the [[Sweet Track]]. The museum closed in 2009 and its status remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peat Moors Centre|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=6886&amp;mode=&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0|publisher=Magalithic Portal|accessdate=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
