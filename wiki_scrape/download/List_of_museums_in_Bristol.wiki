The [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]], [[unitary authority area]] and [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of [[Bristol]] contains a wide range of [[museum]]s, defined here as institutions (including [[nonprofit organisation]]s, government entities, and private [[business]]es) that collect and care for objects of cultural, artistic, scientific, or historical interest and make their collections or related exhibits available for public viewing. Non-profit [[Art museum|art galleries]] and university art galleries are also included, but museums that exist only in cyberspace (i.e., [[virtual museum]]s) are not.

Many of the museums are in [[listed building]]s. In the United Kingdom, this signifies a building which has been placed on the Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest. In [[England and Wales]], the authority for listing is granted by the [[Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990]], and is presently administered by [[English Heritage]]. Listed buildings in danger of decay are included on English Heritage's [[Buildings at Risk Register]]. There are three types of listed status: Grade I, for buildings &quot;of exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important&quot;; Grade II*, for &quot;particularly important buildings of more than special interest&quot;; and Grade II, for buildings that are &quot;nationally important and of special interest&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Listed buildings|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/protecting/heritage-protection/what-can-we-protect/listed-buildings/|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the museums have been accredited by the [[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council]], which sets national standards for museums in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Accreditation Scheme|url=http://www.mla.gov.uk/what/raising_standards/accreditation|publisher=The [[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council]] (MLA)|accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several are [[art gallery|art galleries]] providing space for the [[art exhibition|exhibition of art]], or are [[Science museum|science]], [[Transport museum|transport]], [[Railway museum|railway]], medical or religious museums. The majority of the museums are found within walking distance of [[Bristol Harbour]] and have links with the history of the port. There are also [[historic house museum]]s owned or managed by [[Politics of Bristol#City Council|Bristol City Council]], the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] or [[English Heritage]].

It has a programme of [[contemporary art]] exhibitions, live art, music and dance events, poetry and book readings, talks, lectures and cinema. There is also a specialist art bookshop and a café bar. Educational activities are undertaken and experimental digital media work supported by online resources. A number of festivals are regularly hosted by the gallery. Arnolfini is funded by [[Bristol City Council]] and [[Arts Council England]], with some corporate and individual supporters. The gallery was founded in 1961 by [[Jeremy Rees]], and was originally located in [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]]. In the 1970s it moved to [[Queen Square, Bristol|Queen Square]], before moving to its present location. In 1975, Arnolfini moved to its present home in Bush House, occupying two floors of a 19th century Grade II* [[listed building|listed]] [[tea]] warehouse situated on the side of the [[Floating Harbour]] in [[Bristol city centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/93024?docPos=14 |title=Rees, Jeremy Martin|format=Subscription required|date=May 2007|last=Hedley|first=Gill

While other ships had previously been built of iron or equipped with a [[screw propeller]], ''Great Britain'' was the first to combine these features in a large ocean-going ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Claxton|first= Capt.

However, her protracted construction and high cost had left her owners in a difficult financial position, and they were forced out of business in 1846 after the ship was stranded by a [[navigation]]al error.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Great Britain Sinks!|journal=Cruising|publisher=[[The Cruising Association]]|author=Ted Osborn|date=June 2010|pages=24–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sold for [[marine salvage|salvage]] and repaired, ''Great Britain'' carried thousands of [[Immigration to Australia|immigrants]] to Australia until converted to sail in 1881. Three years later, the vessel was retired to the [[Falkland Islands]] where she was utilised as a warehouse, quarantine ship and [[hulk (ship)|coal hulk]] until [[scuttling|scuttled]] in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gibbs | first = Charles Robert Vernon | title = Passenger Liners of the Western Ocean: A Record of Atlantic Steam and Motor Passenger Vessels from 1838 to the Present Day | location = | publisher = John De Graff | year = 1957 | oclc = | pages = 41–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, ''Great Britain'' was returned to the Bristol [[dry dock]] where she was first built.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Anon|title=SS ''Great Britain''|publisher=The Greywell Press|location=Farnborough|year=1986|accessdate=January 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brunel200.com/ss_great_britain.htm|title=SS Great Britain|work=Brunel 200|accessdate=31 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now listed as part of the [[National Historic Fleet, Core Collection]], the vessel is an award-winning visitor attraction and [[museum ship]] in [[Bristol Harbour]], with between 150,000–170,000 visitors annually.

On display were items from Bristol's industrial past – including aviation, car and bus manufacture, and printing – and exhibits documenting Bristol's maritime history. The museum was managed by [[Bristol City Council]] along with nearby preserved industrial relics along Prince's Wharf, including the [[Bristol Harbour Railway]], cranes and a small fleet of preserved vessels. There are no plans to decommission or remove the railway, cranes or vessels. The museum closed its doors to the public on 29 October 2006. The new [[M Shed]] is being built on the site, keeping the same façade. It is due to open spring 2011.
