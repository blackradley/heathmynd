This '''list of museums in [[Wiltshire]], [[England]]''' contains [[museum]]s which are defined for this context as institutions (including [[nonprofit organization]]s, government entities, and private [[business]]es) that collect and care for objects of cultural, artistic, scientific, or historical interest and make their collections or related exhibits available for public viewing. Also included are non-profit art galleries and university art galleries.  Museums that exist only in cyberspace (i.e., [[virtual museum]]s) are not included.  
&lt;!-- Note: Please do not post websites for museums with existing Wikipedia articles, but please do verify that the existing article has the correct website. In this way, if the website changes, only the main article needs to be updated. --&gt;
